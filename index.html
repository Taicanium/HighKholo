<div class="subdiv" id="introduction">
<h2>Gnolls, and the Language Thereof</h2>
<p>This guide details the dialect most commonly spoken among <a href="//pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kholo#tabber-2E" target="_blank">kholo</a> of the <a href="//pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mwangi_Expanse" target="_blank">Mwangi Expanse</a>, as opposed to those dialects spoken in <a href="//pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Katapesh" target="_blank">Katapesh</a> or other areas.<br>Commonly referred to as High Kholo, reflecting the Mwangi gnolls' greater (by comparison) penchant for civilized culture and trade.</p>

<h2>Sound Guide</h2>
<p>High Kholo, being a language of hyenafolk, is designed at its core with sounds pronounceable by the muzzle of a hyena. Its phonemes can all be approximated by a human, and many are identical to human sounds.</p>
<p>In the consonant inventory above, each letter in a grid cell corresponds roughly to a human phoneme.<br>Not all are direct translations, however. Follow below for a guide on the unique sounds exclusive to Kholo, and information on how to best approximate those sounds as a human.</p><br>
<h3>Bidentals</h3>
<p>Made with the jaws clenched and the teeth bared.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fricative &lt;<i>nh</i>&gt;</b>: This sound is essentially the linguistic rendition of a growl. Functionally speaking, it consists of gritting the teeth and loudly exhaling between them.<br>Two approximations exist. The first is closer to the real sound, consisting of gritting your teeth and exhaling. The second is more comfortable for human speakers at the cost of being a looser interpretation: Press your tongue to the back of your teeth and loudly exhale around it, similar to the 'll' sound of Welsh.</li>
<li><b>Nasal &lt;<i>nn</i>&gt;</b>: In contrast to the fricative, this sound is closer to a hiss or a whine. The teeth are gritted as before, but the speaker exhales through their nose instead of between their teeth.<br>This sound also has two human interpretations. The looser one is to make an 'enye' sound, as &ntilde;.</li>
<li><b>Approximant &lt;<i>jh</i>&gt;</b>: This sound existed in prior ages, but fell out around the time paper-based writing was introduced through contact with the Osirians. It persists in other dialects, and is preserved in writing for that purpose.<br>To make it, open your mouth wide, bring your teeth together quickly, then exhale as you bring them apart again; like you're making a 'y' sound but with your teeth instead of your tongue.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Interdentals</h3>
<p>Made with the tongue pressed adjacent to the fangs. In humans this position would be equivalent to behind the incisors but ahead of the canines, if such a space existed.</p>
<p>These sounds all roughly correspond to ordinary human consonants, and no special notes are needed for them. The one exception is the interdental latrant, which is covered below.</p>
<br>
<h3>Glottals</h3>
<p>These are sounds made using the throat as the primary articulator, rather than the tongue or teeth. There are two, the plosive and the fricative; both of which directly correspond to human sounds.</p>
<p>The glottal fricative is the classic 'h' sound. It is doubled in Kholo writing to help distinguish it from numerous other sounds that use 'h' as a modifier instead of a letter &mdash; 'nh,' 'sh,' among others.</p>
<p>The glottal plosive, written with an apostrophe ('), indicates that the speaker should briefly interrupt their flow of air before resuming it. "Ah-ah-ah!" is a common human saying that uses this sound.</p>
<br>
<h3>Latrants</h3>
<p>From an older Common word meaning 'barking,' latrant consonants are made with the tongue starting slack and rapidly accelerating towards the target position. These are the language's famous yips and barks that outsiders associate with the hyenafolk, and arguably the hardest for outsiders to pronounce.<br>There are three distinct latrant consonants in High Kholo:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Dental &lt;<i>y</i>&gt;</b>: The classic yipping sound. The tip of the tongue touches behind the front fangs of the muzzle, usually forcing a front (high-pitched) vowel sound.<br>Make a fast 'y' sound, but end it with your tongue barely touching your upper teeth, sort of like you're making a cross between a 'y' and an 'l' sound.<br><i>This is not the same as the English 'y'!</i> That sound is called a palatal approximant, and it's written with a 'j' in Kholo.</li>
<li><b>Interdental &lt;<i>yy</i>&gt;</b>: The tongue comes to rest between the middle fangs.<br>Make a fast, exaggerated 'y' sound with your tongue curling up towards the front of your mouth. Try saying 'giddy-up' very, very quickly, and you'll have the idea.</li>
<li><b>Palatal &lt;<i>yh</i>&gt;</b>: The classic barking sound. The tongue curls up to the roof of the mouth, and the jaws part wider during vocalization.<br>Curl your tongue like in the interdental, but further upward - towards the back of your mouth instead of the front. Your mouth will want to open wider when you do this; let it. This sound takes some practice, and may be uncomfortable the first few tries. It's easier if you imagine yourself literally barking.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Vowels</h3>
<p>Kholo contains seven core vowel sounds, notably fewer than Common. It also contains fewer diphthongs (such as the 'oy' or 'aye' sounds in English), a product of its speakers who readily prefer articulated consonants. The diphthongs that Kholo does contain are often written with a vowel-consonant group, such as 'oj,' rather than as two vowels.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A &lt;ɑː&gt;</b>: the 'a' in British English 'f<b>a</b>ther'.</li>
<li><b>E &lt;ɛ&gt;</b>: 'e' as in North American English 'b<b>e</b>d' or 'w<b>e</b>t'.</li>
<li><b>I &lt;ɪ&gt;</b>: 'i' as in 'f<b>i</b>ckle' or 'b<b>i</b>gger'.</li>
<li><b>Ii &lt;iː&gt;</b>: Long 'ee' sound as in 'fr<b>ee</b>'.</li>
<li><b>O</b>: No universal equivalent. It follows the mid-vowel sound seen, e.g. in the word 'pl<b>u</b>s' spoken in the Philadelphia and Norfolk accents, or in the word 'Camb<b>o</b>dia' as spoken in Yorkshire or the General American accent.<br>The simplest analogy would be to take the standard 'Oh' sound, and remove the narrowing to a 'u' that commonly follows at the end.</li>
<li><b>U &lt;ʌ&gt;</b>: Soft 'uh' sound as in 'b<b>u</b>n' or 'M<b>o</b>nday'.</li>
<li><b>Uu &lt;uː&gt;</b>: Long 'oo' sound as in North American English 'cart<b>oo</b>n' or 's<b>oo</b>n'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Samples</h2>
<p>Kholo is written in one of two modes: The normal style, with each letter separate; and the "semi-cursive" style, where each letter is horizontally connected to the next.</p>
<p>The normal style is used in printing, and the semi-cursive style is more common in handwriting (making it by far more common in general). Semi-cursive is more socially formal than normal style; the latter tends to appear more childish.</p>
<p>In semi-cursive style, vowels written at the start of a word (see above) are not connected.</p><br>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>Kholo generally follows a subject-object-verb sentence structure: "Timmy the ball kicks".<br>The language is remarkably flexible, however. In most settings, the only strict requirement is that the object follow the subject.</p>
<p>Verb-subject-object ("Kicks Timmy the ball") is a common format in flowery, poetic systems; but tends to be seen as archaic or eccentric in speech.<br>In more casual writing or conversation, subject-verb-object ("Timmy kicks the ball," as in Common) is seen as more formal than the norm, and this is usually sufficient.</p>
<p>Adjectives follow the noun they modify, unless compounded or used as prefixes. There is no strict requirement for which form to use, though the prefix form is discouraged if the noun is already particularly long. (What counts as "particularly long" is up to personal taste.)</p><br>
<h2>Declension</h2>
<p>Kholo declines nouns and verbs according to a fusional suffix system. These suffixes indicate tense, the number of both the subject and object of a sentence, as well as the level of formality.</p><br>
<h3>Nominal Suffixes</h3>
<p>As the name implies, in most cases only the noun declines for number and formality; its adjectives are left alone.</p>
<p>The same word, if used more than once, can drop its nominal suffix following the first usage; unless the number or quality changes.</p>

<li>Members of other species, no matter how friendly or how high-ranking, are always non-kholo (with one exception: See grammar notes on the mandatory mood). Separate parts of a kholo's physical body (e.g. the arms, legs, or head) are also non-kholo.</li>
<li>In contrast to body parts, metaphysical parts of a kholo &mdash; such as the soul, thoughts, feelings, or the (metaphorical) heart &mdash; are kholo.<br>A note is also made for monstrous offspring bred through reverence of <a href="//pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lamashtu" target="_blank">Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters</a>. These are always kholo, with one exception: Those incorporating humanlike features are non-kholo.</li>

<h3>Verbal Suffixes</h3>
<p>Kholo does not natively distinguish a future tense. Indicating an action yet to be taken is done via context. When it must be made explicit, the closest equivalent is to prepend the word "ta-" ("Time") to the related verb as a prefix, though native speakers find this clunky.</p>

<h2>Cases and Moods</h2>
<h3>Aspirational</h3>
<p>The aspirational mood generalizes showing a desire, a want, a need, or a wish. In the simplest case, it takes the form of a standard "I want" statement; but Kholo is unique in having a formal system for the nuance of different levels of a desire, and the target of that desire.</p>
<p>Kholo differentiates wants and needs based on physical compulsions as much as emotional attachments. Important also is whether or not the desire is achievable in the first place. People often wish for things that they know they can never have, and kholo are no different.</p>
<p>Desires are thus given using the <b>four aspirations</b>, groups of related interfixes.</p>

<span class="smalltext quoteBlock">"Grief is a special case. It's certainly a type of longing, but it's a longing that persists in spite of knowing that what we desire is only a dream.<br>[...] The point of this system is to illustrate how we <i>feel</i>. And in grief, we <i>feel</i> as though we can be with loved ones again - it may take living the rest of our lives and dying of old age, but we nonetheless believe reunion to be a possibility. And we believe in it so strongly that the academic question of 'is it physically possible?' ceases to be relevant."<br><span style="margin-left: 4em;"> &mdash; Grove of Narrow Elm; assoc. prof. emeritus of Theology, University of Lepidstadt</span></span>
<br>
<h3>Conditional</h3>
<p>The conditional mood shows a potential or hypothetical action being taken, as in uses of the Common "if" or "would".<br>To indicate an action reliant on another (as in Common "if"), Kholo constructs a present-tense sentence, followed by the conditional action:</p>

<br>
<p>To indicate a hypothetical action (as in Common "would"), Kholo relies on making the action statement and then rejecting it:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Kholo</th>
<th>Common (literal)</th>
<th>Common (proper)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Ba owja'nha khlita, uubasja."</td>
<td>"I break your paw, but I do not."</td>
<td>"I would break your paw."</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Note the use of "uubasja," a contraction of "u ba se'a," meaning "but I do not".</p><br>
<h3>Genitive</h3>
<p>The genitive case indicates ownership, possession, or association. In Common, this case is shown with the suffix 's, as in "Timmy's ball," or with the particle 'of,' as in "the Ides of March."<br>Kholo follows a principle of attribution, whereby the owner or possessor is treated as an adjective of the owned noun:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Kholo</th>
<th>Common</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Yyuumi Yyii'ta"</td>
<td>"Thorn's prey"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Shava'nha"</td>
<td>"Your heart"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Aljanik awoa"</td>
<td>"The god of gold"</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<h3>Imperative</h3>
<p>The imperative mood indicates an instruction or directive from the speaker to the listener. Common shows this case by constructing a present-tense, second-person sentence ("You take a left at this stop sign") and omitting the subject pronoun ("Take a left at this stop sign").<br>Kholo imperatives follow a similar structure: The pronoun is omitted, and the verb is left unmodified if informal, or made present-tense if formal.</p>
<p>The imperative mood differs from the mandatory mood in that an imperative is a request or otherwise informational, whereas a mandate is a direct command or order.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Kholo</th>
<th>Common</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Nno alkhit'ba."</td>
<td>"Write my legend."</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Hhja ber!"</td>
<td>"Sing for me!"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"Vrito hhja'ba nhaj'er."</td>
<td>"Allow me to sing for you."</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<h3>Mandatory</h3>
<p>Corresponding roughly to the Common 'must,' the mandatory mood is a more specific version of the imperative; it shows a requirement for the listener to perform a command or directive.<br>In Common this mood is extremely simple to the point of barely differing from the imperative in terms of grammar. In Kholo, however, distinct grammatical rules and levels of formality are used to avoid giving offense through commanding another member of the pack.</p>
<p>The mandatory mood follows a vocabulary structure like that of the imperative. However, unlike other moods, a mandate is not merely a set of vocabulary and declension rules, but a full set of behavioral observations that sentences must adhere to.</p>
<p>The rules of the mandatory mood are strictly observed; in the harshest of packs, to deviate is to instantly invite exile upon oneself, a fate often considered worse than death.</p>

<br>
<h3>Potential</h3>
<p>The potential case corresponds to the Common verb phrase "to be able" and its conjugations, such as "I can" and "I could".</p>
<p>Among the grammatical cases shown so far, the potential is by far the simplest: Attach the suffix -wa to the relevant pronoun, and decline the verb (if the sentence has one) as normal.</p>
<p>To negate the potential, as in "I could not" or "He cannot," apply the -'a suffix in addition.</p>

<h2>Non-Doubled Suffixes</h2>
<p>A set of grammar rules exists for when to prevent accidental doubling of consonant and vowel sounds in Kholo, especially when applying suffixes.<br>When amended with suffixes for tense, number and formality: If a word already ends in the major consonant sound of the suffix, that sound should be removed before the suffix is applied.</p>
<table>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inkh</td>
<td>Knee</td>

<tr>

</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The rule is generally applied for very similar consonant sounds on a case-by-case basis. Non-native speakers may or may not struggle with deciding what counts as "similar," but aspirated consonants are the easiest to figure out.</p>

<p>There are rare instances in which a root word ends with a cluster identical to a suffix. These are often, though not always, words which incorporate some level of inherent formality; such as <i>alim</i> (queen). In these cases, the suffix is omitted entirely rather than altered or doubled.</p>

<h2>Sonorization</h2>
<p>Kholo speech tends to sonorize (i.e. morph from voiceless to voiced) consonants which occur at the beginning of a word preceded by an ending voiceless consonant.<br>This change is formalized to the point that it is frequently glossed in writing, but not consistently.</p>
<p>Formal texts will usually gloss sonorization in dialogue while preserving the original spelling in narration and other contexts. Highly formalized texts, such as ancestral codices or missives between cultures, are the most likely to gloss sonorization in all contexts.</p>
<p>Informal texts, meanwhile, tend to ignore sonorized initial consonants entirely, using only the voiceless original spelling. In other words, for most Kholo, sonorization is a purely vocal phenomenon; its display in casual writing is a giveaway that the writer is either a foreigner or an egghead.</p>

<p>Kholo infamously features 37 words to distinguish between the types of slaves in their culture.<br>These are organized into six groups differing by their purpose and in harshness of their treatment.<br>Slaves in the two 'highest' groups, indentured and personal servants, are owned by single kholo or families, and further ranked according to the work they do.<br>Lower types are communally owned, and not differentiated in this way.</p>
<p><i>Wik</i> (plural <i>wakh</i>) is a generic word referring to a worker of any type.<br>When it appears as a suffix in the name of a servant type, it may be replaced with <i>wa</i> ("respectable work") or <i>triip</i> ("menial work") to refer to the labor itself.</p>

<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>From birth, kholo youths are given a 'root' for a name: A single word of natural origin, such as an animal, plant, or natural feature; or a part of such. As they age and gain notoriety, they may choose to add modifiers or adjectives to this root, symbolizing their growth and accomplishments.</p>
<p>A kholo born with the root name 'Ash' may further name themselves 'Ash upon Ground' when reaching maturity. When slaying their first grave monstrosity, they may become 'Ash upon Arid Ground'. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>It is not common, but nor is it rare, for kholo to give each other such a naming element; some long-bonded parties practice this as a means of tying themselves to each other.</p><br>

<h2>Matriarchy</h2>
<p>Kholo society is famously matriarchal, whereby female huntresses &mdash; taller, stronger, and more naturally assertive than their male counterparts &mdash; play a dominant role in social ruling and organization.<br>There are aspects of the Kholo language that are either explicitly or implicitly gendered accordingly.</p>
<p>Take as an example the singular formal suffix, '-(w)im'. It is derived from the native word for female, 'imo'. The word for daughter, 'ima,' is also related.<br>Informal common nouns are not given a suffix. 'Kholo,' as a native word meaning 'tribal predator,' therefore technically refers to a male, while 'kholowim' would be used to address a female listener. In human society, this distinction would likely come across as othering the listener.</p>
<p>Here, though, it is actually those without the suffix who are othered &mdash; the suffix is honorable, and is culturally treated like a noble title. It is important to remember that matriarchy is the default in kholo society, and assumptions are made by both speaker and listener accordingly.</p>
<p>Male kholo are excluded from reference with formal suffixes under almost all circumstances. It is easier to list the exceptions to that rule, rather than elaborate on the rule directly. Namely:<br>Elderly males are entitled to formal address by their grandchildren, but not by their adult children.<br>Furthermore, a bonecarver or storyteller is entitled to formality from other males and young females of his tribe; but not from adult females.</p>
<p>Individual exceptions are rarely also made for highly accomplished warriors, but these may be as rare as once in a generation.</p><br>

<h2>Literature</h2>
<h3>Alkhitakh Hhama'ba</h3>
<p>The <i>Alkhitakh Hhama'ba</i> is a collection of kholo folktales most comparable to <i>Aesop's Fables</i> or <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i>. As possibly the most comprehensive piece of native Kholo writing, its use is indispensable for outsiders in understanding cultural norms and nuance in an otherwise profoundly bellicose species.</p>
<p>Its stories mostly center around a male kholo named Thorn, whose growth from youth to elder bonecarver is traced via exploits as a slaver, a brief reformist for the latter system, and a servant to a huntress whom eventually married him. Thorn has long been interpreted as a symbol of virtue for male kholo youths. His characterization as a level-headed, pragmatic, yet unflinchingly bloodthirsty warrior and a friend to outside peoples (as friendly as a kholo can reasonably be called) suggests a model for males to follow in a strongly female-dominated society.</p>
<p>The collection's name means "Legends of my Father," or "Stories of my Father," making its use as a teaching tool for male kholo even more obvious.</p><br>

<h3>Tejalima</h3>
<p>The <i>Tejalima</i> ("Huntress-queen") is a lyrical work handed down across generations by adventuring kholo minstrels, both inside and outside of the Mwangi Expanse. Its exact verses are as diverse as the bards who recite it, but at its core the <i>Tejalima</i> follows Lynx, a kholo huntress of ancient days who befriended a human settler from what would one day become Katapesh. The settler, whose name is never given, was wounded in a civil conflict and left for dead on the savannah; Lynx, intending to turn a profit against a slaver, captured the settler, but grew fond of him during their extended return deeper into the Expanse.</p>
<p>Friendship between kholo and humans is a not-uncommon plot device of traditional Kholo literature, but the <i>Tejalima</i> is unique in presenting Lynx's affection for the settler as inherently and dramatically doomed: Tribal and uncivilized, she is able to patch his wounds but cannot aid him when they become infected. Through multiple stanzas spanning months of travel, the settler attempts to hide his affliction from Lynx, but becomes progressively weaker. He loses his will and dies shortly before reaching their final destination, never knowing that Lynx had resolved at the last to spare him from slavery.</p>
<p>The lyricism concludes by returning to its initial praise of the freedom in life in the Expanse, though now cast in a colder light. Lynx is said to have faded into the savannah, her life as a huntress irrevocably coloured by her encounter with the settler. Interpretations vary as to whether she had developed romantic feelings for the settler; those that favour this perception ironically tend to be more cynical, casting all attachment with outside peoples as doomed from the start.</p>
<p>In all, the <i>Tejalima</i> has historically acted as a conservative influence on Kholo culture, reminding the lead huntresses of Mwangi tribes not to show mercy to their quarries nor to slack in their duties. This lesson contrasts with those presented in the <i>Alkhitakh Hhama'ba</i>, mirroring the different social expectations of male versus female kholo.</p>
<p>As a strictly musical piece, the <i>Tejalima</i> is highly favoured by kholo bards who have ventured far afield, as the tragedy of its story coupled with its lamenting, somber accompaniment is famously moving when performed by a talented musician. The piece showcases the Kholo scheme of rhyming sentences according to their beginning sounds, rather than the ending sounds as in Common. Furthermore, each stanza follows a different meter than those before and after, and each line within a stanza alternates the number of syllables, providing exceptional flexibility for the bard.</p>
